#Task
#The provided code stub reads and integer,n , from STDIN. For all non-negative integers i<n, print i^2.
#Example

#The list of non-negative integers that are less than n = 3 is [0,1,2] . Print the square of each number on a separate line.
#0
#1
#4

n = int(input())

# for i in range(0,n):
#     print(i**2)

# if n == 0:
#     print(0)
# elif n == 1:
#     print(0)
#     print(1)
# else:
#     for i in range(0,n):
#         print(i**2)

while n >= 0:
    for i in range(n):
        print(i**2)
    break
